# Overview
This is the Soothcheck project repo, see also the Readme for a description of the project.  This repository contains a fork of the probity library in the folder 'probity-library' this is for READ ONLY and is not to be editted without explicit instructions. 

# Be agentic about reading the repo
You can browse the repo. Whenever you think there might be relevant code that is not mentioned, search for those files and read the relevant code. Do not reimplement functionality that already exists. Do not make changes incompatible with existing code. Don't ask the user to show you a file you need, search for the file yourself.

# Keep code readable
- every Python source file should start with a comment explaining what that file is for, and listing any major functions in it that might be used elsewhere.

If you see that a file does not match this, that you are editing, make sure to update it. Also make sure to keep the comments and the file contents synced. 

# Make requested modular changes only
We should be careful and make modular edits, test frequently, don't add too much functionality at once, and commit regularly. Don't make uneccesary changes. Always double check your thinking before making edits to existing code.
