# ## Dataset Creation
# To train our probe, we'll create a dataset similar to the one used in the paper Linear Representations of Sentiment (Tigges & Hollinsworth, et al). We will use Probity's TemplatedDataset class, which allows us to specify templates with auto-populating blanks. For convenience, we have a simple function that applies the movie sentiment template.
#
# Once the TemplatedDataset is created, we simply convert it to a ProbingDataset (which gives us features like labels, word positions by character, and test-train splits) and then a TokenizedProbingDataset (which gives us additional information about token positions, context length, and so forth). We keep these distinct because TokenizedProbingDatasets are tied to specific models, whereas ProbingDatasets are not.

# ## Probe Training
# ### Configuration
# We're now ready to train the probe! We specify the training parameters via the three config objects below. The Pipeline manages the whole process, and the Trainer and Probe have their own settings.

# %% Configure model and probe
model_name = "gpt2"
hook_point = "blocks.7.hook_resid_pre"

# Set up logistic probe configuration
probe_config = LogisticProbeConfig(
    input_size=768,
    normalize_weights=True,
    bias=False,
    model_name=model_name,
    hook_point=hook_point,
    hook_layer=7,
    name="sentiment_probe",
)

# Set up trainer configuration
trainer_config = SupervisedTrainerConfig(
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    num_epochs=10,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    train_ratio=0.8,  # 80-20 train-val split
    handle_class_imbalance=True,
    show_progress=True,
    standardize_activations=True, # Empirically, this produces better results
)

pipeline_config = ProbePipelineConfig(
    dataset=tokenized_dataset,
    probe_cls=LogisticProbe,
    probe_config=probe_config,
    trainer_cls=SupervisedProbeTrainer,
    trainer_config=trainer_config,
    position_key="ADJ",  # We want to probe at the adjective position
    model_name=model_name,
    hook_points=[hook_point],
    cache_dir="./cache/sentiment_probe_cache",  # Cache activations for reuse
)

# %%
# Let's make sure the position key is correct
model = HookedTransformer.from_pretrained(model_name)

example = tokenized_dataset.examples[0]
print(f"Example text: {model.to_str_tokens(example.text, prepend_bos=False)}")
print(f"Token positions: {example.token_positions}")
print(f"Available position keys: {list(example.token_positions.keys())}")

# Verify the position key matches what's in the dataset
print(f"\nPipeline position key: {pipeline_config.position_key}")

# %% [markdown]
# Looks like the key tokens are in the right positions. GPT2's default behavior (as implemented in the AutoTokenizer) is not to add a BOS, so we're fine in that respect.
#
# ### Training
# Let's train the probe!

# %% Collect activations
# Create and run pipeline
pipeline = ProbePipeline(pipeline_config)

probe, training_history = pipeline.run()

# The probe now contains our learned sentiment direction
sentiment_direction = probe.get_direction()

# %%
# We can analyze training history

# # Now we'll test the standardized inference path
# 
# ## Understanding how inference differs from training
# 
# When running inference with a trained probe, it's important to understand:
# 
# 1. **Position keys are only used during training** - While we specified `position_key="ADJ"` during training
#    to learn the sentiment direction specifically from adjective positions, the trained probe doesn't "remember"
#    this position information during inference.
# 
# 2. **Inference applies to all tokens** - The probe is applied to every token in the input text, giving
#    a score for each token position. This means even function words like "the" and "and" get scores.
#    
# 3. **Format independence** - You can run inference on any text format, not just the template used for training.
#    However, the probe will be most reliable when applied to similar linguistic patterns as seen during training.


# %%
# Method 1: Inference with the trained probe object
print("===== Inference with trained probe object =====")

# Create a ProbeInference instance with the trained probe
inference = ProbeInference(
    model_name=model_name, hook_point=hook_point, probe=probe, device=device
)

# Create some test examples with different formats than our training template
test_examples = [
    "The movie was incredible and I loved every minute of it.",  # Similar to training format
    "That film was absolutely terrible and I hated it.",         # Similar format with synonyms
    "The acting was mediocre but I liked the soundtrack.",       # Mixed sentiment 
    "A beautiful story with outstanding performances.",          # Different format
]

# Get raw activation scores along the probe direction
raw_scores = inference.get_direction_activations(test_examples)

    print(f"\nOverall document sentiment: {overall_sentiment:.4f} ({'Positive' if overall_sentiment > 0.6 else 'Negative' if overall_sentiment < 0.4 else 'Neutral'})")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Observations on the token-level scores
# 
# Looking at the token-level breakdown:
# 
# 1. **Content words matter most**: Words like "incredible", "terrible", "loved", and "hated" show 
#    the strongest sentiment signals, while function words like "the" and "and" are more neutral.
# 
# 2. **Contextual influence**: Even seemingly neutral words can be affected by surrounding context. 
#    The same word might get different scores in different sentences.
# 
# 3. **Format robustness**: The probe works well on sentences with different structures than our training
#    template, showing it captures generalizable sentiment features.
#
# 4. **Aggregation strategy**: Taking the mean across all tokens is simple but not always optimal. 
#    In practice, you might want to weight content words more heavily or focus on specific parts of speech.
